# clustered-map

This is a simple project to create a clustered map to show where grant awards from the Economic Development Administration have gone in FY20. It was done primarily in R, with some help of advanced Excel macros to assign lat/long coordinates using the Google API. I'll provide information on how to replicate within this file as well.

One nice feature of this map is that it uses clustered data, rather than one big map with about 1000 points on it across the US. In the future I'd like to build in some filtering functionaliy, but that's for another day.
